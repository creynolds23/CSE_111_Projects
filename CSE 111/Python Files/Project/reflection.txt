Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The experience that I had with functions is definitely when we started using dictionaries. Without functions
I think dictionaries would be very difficult to work with and keep organized throughout a program. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

In my judgment I do think that they are very worthwhile. At this point in time I am still not
very familiar and confident in using test files. Could possibly be because I am not sure how to do
a test file for my final project I chose or that I am not executing them in the right way.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

One thing that I can do to improve my process is actually use the debug tool that python has and all other ones have. When 
I troubleshoot my code I just run my code over and over until I get something else in the terminal, instead of stepping through 
the code and seeing the exact spot it is wrong at.
